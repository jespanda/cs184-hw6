            <h2>Extended Room </h2>
            <h4>Improvements</h4>
            <p>For this project, we decided to extend HW4.  We decided to add on a particle effect and transparency, which we accomplished. </p>

                <li>Particle Effect</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>In the video, you can see that there is a particle effect to mimic steam</li>
                    </ul>
                <li>Transparency</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>In the video, you can see that there is a fish tank with a fish inside.  This effect is created through two transparent cubes placed within one another.</li>

                <ul>
                    <li> The basic setup for our scene will be one of those "floating boat" type sushi bars </li>
                    <li> T We'll have a number of different kinds of sushi on top of (textured) rice clumps </li>
                    <li> TBasic setting for a restaurant dining table </li>

                <ul>
                    <li> Using scene.txt format, modified and enhanced </li>
                </ul>

            <h4>At least one object must be textured with a suitable image</h4>
                <ul>

                <ul>
                    <li>Changing textures for paintings</li>
